# odoo_modules_features

A list of features of some odoo modules

## Workflow

Everyone should add features they found to the file 'FEATURES.md'.

Everyone should create their own branch based on 'develop' in github(yes, based on 'develop', not 'master') and raise merge/pull reuqests to 'develop' branch.

Raise pull requests, donot merge by yourself.
